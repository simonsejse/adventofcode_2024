# Advent of Code 2024 - Learning Haskell

This repository contains my **Advent of Code 2024** solutions written in **Haskell**. I'm using this as an opportunity to learn Haskell, coming from an **F# background** and experience with other languages.

The code here is focused on exploration and learning rather than being polished or optimized. Suggestions and feedback are always welcome!

Enjoy exploring, and happy coding! ðŸŽ„
